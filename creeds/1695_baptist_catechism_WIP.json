    "OriginStory": "'Having a desire to shew our near Agreement with many other Christians, of whom we have great Esteem; we some Years since put forth a Confession of our Faith, almost in all Points the same with that of the Assembly, and Savoy, which was subscribed by the Elders and Messengers of many churches baptized on profession of their Faith; and do now put forth a short Account of Christian Principles, for the Instruction of our Families, in most things agreeing with the Shorter Catechism of the Assembly. And this we were the rather induced to, because we have commonly made use of that Catechism in our Families: And the Difference being not much, it will be more easily committed to Memory.'",
