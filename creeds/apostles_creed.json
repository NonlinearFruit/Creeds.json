The earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus ('Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books') of St. Pirminius, written between 710 and 714.",

On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, he is seated at the right hand of the Father, and he will come to judge the living and the dead.\n\nI believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen."
