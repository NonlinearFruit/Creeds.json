          "Number": "1",
          "Question": "Seeing a chief supposes an inferior end; what is that inferior end for which man was made?",
          "Answer": "It is prudently, soberly, and mercifully, to govern, use, and dispose of other creatures in the earth, sea, and air, over which God gave man the dominion; Genesis 1:26. And God said let us make man in our own image, after our likeness: and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the bird of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. So Psalm 8:6. You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet."

          "Question": "What then is to be thought of those men, who being wholly intent upon inferior things, forget and neglect their principal end?",
          "Answer": "They are dead while they live; 1 Timothy 5:6. But she that lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives: They have their portion in this life; Psalm 17:14. From men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and their end is destruction, Philippians 3:19. Whose end is destruction."

          "Question": "How can a man glorify God, seeing he is perfectly glorious in himself?",
          "Answer": "Man cannot glorify God by adding any new degree of glory to him; Job 35:7. If you be righteous, what give you him, but by manifesting his glory with the lips? Psalm 50:23. Whoever offers praise, glorifies me; or with the life; Matthew 5:16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven."

          "Question": "Wherein consists the enjoyment of God?",
          "Answer": "It consists, first, in the facial vision of him in Heaven. SECONDLY, in full conformity to him; 1 John 3:2. But we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. THIRDLY, in that full satisfaction which results from both the former; Psalm 17:15. I shall be satisfied when I awake with your likeness."

          "Answer": "No adult person can scripturally expect happiness in Heaven without holiness on earth; Hebrews 12:14. And holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. Romans 8:30. Whom he justified, them he also glorified."

          "Question": "Do all men make God their chief end?",
          "Answer": "No, they do not; some make their sensual pleasure their chief end: Philippians 3:19. Whose God is their belly: and some the world, Colossians 3:5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, and covetousness, which is idolatry."

          "Number": "8",
          "Question": "What are the signs of a man's making himself his chief end?",
          "Answer": "Those make themselves their chief end, who ascribe the glory of what they have, or do, to themselves, and not to God; Daniel 4:30. The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon which I have built? Isaiah 10:18. For he says, by the strength of my hand have I done it; and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; therefore they sacrifice to their own net, and burn incense unto their drag, Habakkuk 1:16."

        {
          "Number": "9",
          "Question": "Why are the glorifying and enjoying of God put together, as making up our chief end?",
          "Answer": "Because no man can glorify God, that takes him not for his God; and none takes him for his God, that takes him not for his supreme good; and both these being essentially included in this notion of the chief end, are therefore justly put together."

          "Question": "What is the second truth inferred hence?",
          "Answer": "That the soul of man is not annihilated by death, but advanced by it; Philippians 1:21. To die is gain, verse 23. Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better."

          "Number": "12",
          "Question": "What is the third truth inferred hence?",
          "Answer": "That it is the duty and wisdom of every Christian to renounce, deny, and forsake all inferior interests and enjoyments, when they come in competition with the glory of God, and our enjoyment of him: Luke 14:33. So likewise whoever he be of you, that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple."

    },
    {
      "Number": "2",
      "Question": "WHAT rule has God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him?",
      "Answer": "The word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and new Testament, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.",
      "SubQuestions": [
        {
          "Number": "1",
          "Question": "How can the Scriptures be called the word of God, seeing the things contained there were spoken and written by men?",
          "Answer": "They are truly and properly called the word of God, because they came not by the will of man; but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, 2 Peter 1:21."
        },
        {
          "Number": "2",
          "Question": "What are the principal arguments to persuade us that the scriptures are of Divine authority and inspiration?",
          "Answer": "Three things especially convince us: FIRST, The holiness of the doctrine therein contained. SECONDLY, The awful efficacy thereof on the soul. THIRDLY, The uncontrollable miracles by which they are sealed, put it beyond all rational doubt that they are the very words of God."
        },
        {
          "Number": "3",
          "Question": "What is the holiness of the scriptures; and how does that prove them to be God's word?.",
          "Answer": "The holiness of the scriptures does appear in two things: FIRST, In commanding and encouraging whatever is pure, and holy; Philippians 4:8. Whatever things are pure. SECONDLY, In forbidding all unholiness, under pain of damnation; 2 Corinthians 6:9. Know you not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, etc. This shows that they came not from Satan, being cross to his design; nor from man, it being against his corrupt nature; and therefore from God only."
        },
        {
          "Number": "4",
          "Question": "What is their authority and efficacy on the soul? and how does that prove them divine?",
          "Answer": "Their authority, and efficacy on the soul, consists in three things: FIRST, In the power they have to search and discover the secrets of men; Hebrews 12:4. The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. SECONDLY, In their converting efficacy, changing and renewing the soul; Psalm 19:7. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. THIRDLY, In their cheering and restoring efficacy, when the soul is cast down under any inward or outward trouble; Psalm 19:8. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. No human power can do such things as these; John 17:17. Sanctify them through your truth; your word is truth."
        },
        {
          "Number": "5",
          "Question": "How do miracles confirm it?",
          "Answer": "Because all proper miracles are wrought only by the hand of God: John 3:2. And no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him: and so are his seal to whatever he affixes them, and it consists not with his truth, and holiness to set it to a forgery."
        },
        {
          "Number": "6",
          "Question": "What was the end of writing the word?",
          "Answer": "That the church to the end of the world might have a sure, known, standing-rule, to try and judge all things by, and not be left to the uncertainty of traditions; John 5:39. Search the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me."
        },
        {
          "Number": "7",
          "Question": "Does not the authority of the scriptures depend on the church, fathers, and councils?",
          "Answer": "No, the scriptures are not built on the authority of the church, but the church on them; Ephesians 2:20. And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone. And as for councils and fathers, the scriptures are not to be tried by them; but they by the scriptures; Isaiah 8:20. To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."

        {
          "Number": "8",
          "Question": "What may be fairly inferred from this proposition, that the scriptures are the word of God?",
          "Answer": "Three things may be hence inferred. FIRST, The perfection of the scriptures, which being the only rule given by God, must therefore be perfect. SECONDLY, That it is the right of common people to read them; John 5:39. Search the scriptures, Acts 17:11. These were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. THIRDLY, That we owe no obedience to the injunctions of men farther than they are sufficiently warranted by the written word; Matthew 15:9. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Of Faith and Obedience"

      "SubQuestions": [
        {
          "Number": "1",
          "Question": "Why is faith conjoined with obedience, and put before it?",
          "Answer": "Because faith is the principle from whence all obedience flows; and no man can perform any duty aright in the estate of unbelief; Hebrews 11:6. But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he who comes to God, must believe that he is."
        },

          "Number": "2",
          "Question": "Can there be no saving faith where the scriptures are not known and preached?",
          "Answer": "No; for the apostle says, Romans 10:14, 15. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent? And verse 17. So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."

          "Number": "3",
          "Question": "Are not we bound to believe what learned men teach us, as points of faith, though the things they teach be not contained in the word of God?",
          "Answer": "No; if the things they teach be not contained expressly, or by necessary consequence in the word of God, we are not obliged to believe them as points of faith; Isaiah 8:20. To the law, and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them: Galatians 1:8. Though we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. And Christ has charged us, Matthew 23:10. To call no man master, for one is your master, even Christ."

          "Question": "Are there some things in scripture more excellent than others; because it is said, the scriptures principally teach matters of faith and duty?",
          "Answer": "Every part of scripture is alike pure; Proverbs 30:5. Every word of God is pure, and of equal authority, but not of equal weight; as several pieces of gold are alike pure, and of the same stamp, but not of equal value."
        },
        {
          "Number": "5",
          "Question": "What may be inferred hence for use?",
          "Answer": "FIRST, Hence it is our duty to examine what we hear, by the word; and not receive any doctrine because men confidently affirm it, but because the scriptures require it; Acts 17:11. These were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether these things were so. SECONDLY, That the Christian religion is not notional, but practical; and that impractical faith saves no man; James 2:20. Faith without works is dead. God is a Spirit"

          "Number": "1",
          "Question": "Can the nature of God be defined, so as men may express properly and strictly what God is?",
          "Answer": "No; Job 11:7. Can you by searching find out God? can you find out the Almighty unto perfection? We do then conceive most rightly of God, when we acknowledge him to be inconceivable; and therefore, one being asked the question, what God is? answered rightly; If I fully knew that, I should be a God myself; for God only knows his own essence."

          "Question": "How many ways are there by which men may know and describe the nature of God, though still with imperfect knowledge?",
          "Answer": "There are two ways of knowing God in this life. FIRST, By way of affirmation; affirming that of God by way of eminence, which is excellent in the creature; as when we affirm him to be wise, good, merciful, etc. SECONDLY, By way of negation, when we remove from God, in our conceptions, all that is imperfect in the creature; so we say, God is immense, infinite, immutable; and in this sense we also call him a Spirit, that is he is not a gross corporeal substance."

          "Question": "If God be a Spirit, in what sense are we to understand all those scriptures which speak of the eyes of the Lord, the ears and hands of God?",
          "Answer": "We are to understand them as expressions of God, in condescension to the weakness of our understanding; even as the glory of Heaven is expressed to us in scripture by a city, and the royal feast. These shadows are useful to us while we are in the body; but we shall know him in Heaven after a more perfect manner."

          "Number": "5",
          "Question": "What may be inferred from the spiritual nature of God?",
          "Answer": "Hence learn, that it is both sinful and dangerous to frame an image or picture of God. Who can make an image of his soul, which yet is not so perfect a spirit as God is? And as it is sinful to attempt it, so it is impossible to do it; Deuteronomy 4:15, 16. Take you therefore good heed unto yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire; lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, etc."

        {
          "Number": "6",
          "Question": "What else may be inferred from thence?",
          "Answer": "That our souls are the most noble and excellent part of us, which most resembles God; and therefore our chief regard and care should be for them, whatever becomes of the vile body; Matthew 16:26. For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
        },
        {
          "Number": "7",
          "Question": "What further truth may be inferred hence?",
          "Answer": "That men should beware of spiritual sins, as well as of gross and outward sins; for there is a faithfulness of the spirit, as well as of the flesh; 2 Corinthians 7:1. Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit; and as God sees them, so he greatly abhors them, as sins that defile the noblest part of man, on which he stamped his own image."

          "Number": "8",
          "Question": "What also may be inferred from hence?",
          "Answer": "Hence we learn, that spiritual worship is most agreeable to his nature and will; and the more spiritual it is, the more acceptable it will be to him; John 4:24. God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Externals in worship are of little regard with God; as places, habits, gestures, etc. Apply this, FIRST, To superstitious men, Isaiah 66:1, 2, 3. SECONDLY, To children, that say a prayer, but mind not to whom, nor what they say, Of God's Infinity"

FIRST, In respect of the perfection of his nature; his wisdom, power, and holiness, exceed all measures and limits; as 1 Samuel 2:2. There is none holy as the Lord, etc. SECONDLY, In respect of time and place; no time can measure him; Isaiah 57:15. Thus says the high and lofty One, that inhabits eternity; 1 Kings 8:27. Behold the Heaven of heavens cannot contain you, how much less this house which I have built? The Heaven of heavens contains all created things; but not the Creator. THIRDLY, In respect of his incomprehensibleness, by the understanding of all creatures; Job 11:7. Can you by searching find out God? Can you find out the Almighty to perfection?"

Forasmuch as you know that we are not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold-but with the precious blood of Christ."

And those that are not reconciled are in a very miserable condition, having infinite power set on work to punish them; 2 Thessalonians 1:9. Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."

If God be eternal, he must be immutable: for if he change by addition of something to him he had not before, then there is something in God which he had not from eternity: And if he change by diminution, then there was something in God from eternity, which now is not; but from everlasting to everlasting he is the same God, and therefore changes not."

And to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant. SECONDLY, In the former no place was found for repentance; in the second, God admits it; Hebrews 8:10. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws in their minds, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people; verse 12. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins will I remember no more. THIRDLY, in their condition, the former requires exact obedience; the latter faith and sincere obedience; Mark 16:16. He who believes, and is baptized, shall be saved."

This covenant is not of works, but of grace, Romans 11:6. And if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.

          "Answer": "It implies man's natural blindness and ignorance; 1 Corinthians 2:14. But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."

That he might present you to himself a glorious church, not having spot nor wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. And from all the penal evils of suffering; Revelation 21:4.

SECONDLY, As he is our Benefactor, from whom we receive all our mercies; Deuteronomy 28:47. Because you served not the Lord your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore shall you serve your enemies, which the Lord shall send against you, in hunger, thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things. THIRDLY, As he is our Lord, and lawgiver; James 4:12. There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy."

          "Answer": "Yes; subjects must obey their lawful magistrates; Romans 13:1. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; The powers that be are ordained of God. People their ministers; Hebrews 13:17. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give an account. Children their parents; Ephesians 6:1.

          "Number": "6",
          "Question": "Why must we obey God rather than man?",
          "Answer": "Because God is the supreme and sovereign Lord of our consciences; and no creature has power to command our obedience but in and from him; Isaiah 33:22. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king, he will save us."

These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."

          "Answer": "That it is highly sinful and dangerous to disobey the known will of God in anything; Romans 1:18. For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Luke 12:47.

Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. Jeremiah 7:31.

          "Answer": "Before ever the law was given at Sinai, all the race of Adam had a law written in their hearts, namely, the light of reason, and dictates of natural conscience; Romans 2:14. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves. And besides this, the church had the revealed will of God to direct them; 2 Peter 1:19, 20. We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto you do well to take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.

          "Answer": "It is not a law to direct and order our manners; but a law that binds universally and perpetually, as the ten commandments do those to whom they are promulged, and the light of nature does all others; Romans 2:14. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves. Luke 16:17.

If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself; you do well: But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors; for whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all."

          "Answer": "God never designed the law to be the way of man's justification since the fall; Galatians 3:21, 22. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law; but the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But it was promulged to convince man of sin; Romans 7:7. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid! Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust except the law had said, You shall not covet. And bring them to Christ; Galatians 3:24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."

Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth? Hebrews 9:27. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, so after this the judgment."

Be not deceived, God is, not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap; for he who sows to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting."

And you, Capernaum, which are exalted unto Heaven, shall be brought down to Hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

And they have not cried unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds: They assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.

Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. They thought the presence and power of God might reach one place, and not another; 1 Kings 20:23.

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handy work: Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge. And these messengers of God were mistaken for God himself; Job 31:26, 27, 28. If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand; this also were an iniquity, for I should have denied the God that is above."

Howbeit, then when you knew not God, you did service unto them which by nature are no gods. But that against the second commandment is, when we pretend to worship the true God, but do it by such means, and in such a manner as he has not required, or has forbidden; Exodus 32:4.

Whoever places them on any other besides God, is guilty of a very heinous and great sin against him; 1 John 2:15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Compared with Job 31:24-28.

Every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the Lord sees us not, the Lord has forsaken the earth. Or inward affections; Colossians 3:5.

For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, etc. Romans 7:22, 23. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.

And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? And he said, Who are you Lord?

And in reading of it, God sometimes comes in by his Spirit to men's conversion; Acts 8:27, 28, 29.

And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.

In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism, etc. And the Lord's supper of the Passover; 1 Corinthians 5:7.

Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility, and worshiping of angels. For the merit and satisfaction of Christ alone give success and acceptance to our prayers; Revelation 8:3, 4. And another angel came, and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God, out of the angel's hand. 1 Timothy 2:5.

A name which none can tell; Proverbs 30:4.-What is his name, and what is his Son's name, if you can tell? A name above every name; Philippians 2:9.

And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.

But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away. Galatians 6:14.

Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. (2.) Be thankful for them; and, (3.) Fruitful with them in acts of piety and charity; 1 Timothy 6:17, 19.

The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For he has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Psalm 50:10, 12. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof. But, (1.) Because we must have a covenant right to it; and, (2.) A civil right; we must come lawfully and honestly by, and so keep the good things of this life; 2 Thessalonians 3:10.

Blessed is every one that fears the Lord: that walks in his ways. For you shall eat the labor of your hands: happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you. Proverbs 10:4, 22.

Come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Verse 30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light; John 15:4, 5. Abide in me, and I in you; as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me you can do nothing.-Verse 7. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you; you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you. John 3 ult.

          "Answer": "Yes, it does so; for the Lord Christ, by his life and death, did satisfy Divine Justice, and did merit our forgiveness: But if he did so, we did not so; our sins cost him dear, but their pardon cost us nothing; our pardon is perfectly free to us, though due to Christ, for God gave Christ freely for us; God accepts of his merits, and applies them to us freely; Romans 3:24.

And he who believes not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him. This is required from us towards our pardon, but yet it is free, (1.)

Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin when it is finished, brings forth death. (2.) Formally, with an intention to draw into sin; and so we are tempted of the devil; 1 Chronicles 21:1. And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. Matthew 4:1, 3. Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. (3.) Innocently, and blamelessly; and so God is said to tempt; 2 Samuel 24:1. And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah."

Howbeit, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land; God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. (2.) By permitting Satan, and wicked men, to tempt; 2 Samuel 24:1. He moved David against them, to say, Go and number Israel and Judah. With 1 Chronicles 21:1. Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David. Matthew 4:1. Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. (3.) By presenting occasions in his providence, which he knows will be abused to sin; as in the fall of Adam, the hardening of Pharaoh, etc."

Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity; and let me not cat of their dainties, Psalm 19:13.

Psalm 51:10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Psalm 119:133. Order my steps in your word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. According to his promise; 1 Corinthians 10:13. But God is faithful, who will not allow himto be tempted above that you are able. 2 Corinthians 12:9.

Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people from Egypt, even until now. In Joshua's, chapter 7:7. And Joshua said, Alas! O Lord God; wherefore have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan. Verse 9. For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: And what will you do unto your great name? In Asa's, 2 Chronicles 14:11. And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power. Help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on you; and in your name we go against this great multitude. O Lord, you are our God; let no man prevail against you. In Jehoshaphat's, 2 Chr. 20:6.-And said, O Lord God of our fathers, are not you God in Heaven? And rule not you over all the kingdoms of the heathen? And in your hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand you? And Hezekiah's, 2 Kings 19:15. And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubim; you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: You have made Heaven and earth.
